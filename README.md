# Step by step tutorial
#### Step 1 - Initial Project
1. In the command line navigate to a folder where you want to create the App <br>
``` $ cd code ```

1. Create a new Angular App using the CLI command `ng new` and provide the name of the App.<br>
` ng new glucose-tracker `

1. Accept the defaults in the command line.

**This is what happened:**
* A new workspace was created with root folder `glucose-tracker`
* An initial skeleton app was created in the `src` folder
* App configuration files were created
* e2e folder was created. For more on how end-to-end testing, visit [Protractor - end to end testing for Angular](https://www.protractortest.org)

We are ready to move to the next step.


# Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
